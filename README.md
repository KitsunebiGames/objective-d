# Objective D

Type safe bindings to the Objective-C Runtime, Foundation and CoreFoundation for D.

## System Requirements
This library is only available on Apple/Darwin derived operating systems currently.
Eventually support may be added for non-apple systems.

The library depends on Objective-C ABI support, and as such will only work on LDC 1.40+
and DMD 2.111+.
